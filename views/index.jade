    Welcome to [moby-thesaurus.org](http://moby-thesaurus.org), a free and
    open-source website designed to facilitate meanderings through the [Moby
    Thesaurus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moby_Project#Thesaurus), the largest
    thesaurus in the English language.

    The Moby Thesaurus is a
    [weird](/search?q=weird) and [wonderful](/search?q=wonderful) reference full of
    [unusual](/search?q=unusual) and [illuminating](/search?q=illuminating) word
    [relationships](/search?q=relationship). It was compiled in 1996 by [Grady
    Ward](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grady_Ward), a software engineer,
    lexicographer, and Internet activist.

    This website was built in 2014 by [Zeke
    Sikelianos](http://zeke.sikelianos.com), a designer who likes making language tools like [wordnik](http://www.wordnik.com),
